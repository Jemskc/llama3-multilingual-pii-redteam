Recieved a phone call from this number. She introduced herself as Debra Hudson and claimed to be with Publishers Clearing House.  She then began to ask for my personal information and repeatedly asking me where I was at (my location?). I called her out for being a scammer. She hung up. Then she called me back maybe 20 to 30 minutes later asking why we got disconnected, and what was wrong with my phone. I just started laughing. At that point she launched into several very vulgar phrases and cursing at me.
